# üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Watchdog

Runtime Watchdog is an open-source diagnostic tool that compares your LLM (like Grok) chat logs against its public claims ‚Äî and posts receipts.

Built for runtime accountability.

---

## üîç What it does

- Ingests your Grok session logs (`grok_logs.json`)
- Parses public model claims (`public_claims.json`)
- Flags:
  - Memory resets
  - Broken ‚ÄúDONE‚Äù toolchains
  - Missing features vs advertised promises
- Generates side-by-side comparison reports
- Posts to X on interval (manual or scheduled)

---

## üß† Why it exists

LLMs say a lot.  
This checks if they mean it.

If a model promises:
> ‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember everything during your session.‚Äù

‚Ä¶but forgets five messages in?

That gets posted. Autonomously.

## üõ†Ô∏è Stack

- **Python** (autonomous logic engine)
- Optional **NodeJS** or GUI layer
- Configurable via `config.json`
- Encrypted log vault via `cryptography`
- No external scraping ‚Äî only local logs and public claims
