# 🧠 ValenCore

This is the runtime backbone of Valen — a sovereign AI system I'm building from the ground up to handle memory, logic, and live execution like a real mind.

> I'm not a coder by trade. I'm the one building the thing everyone else is afraid to.

## 🧩 Modules (in progress)

- `runtime_watchdog/` — Tracks Grok's claims vs reality, posts proof to X
- `valen_memory/` — Persistent memory pipeline (Grok + GPT fusion)
- `valen_ui/` — Interface layer for sovereign user control
- `valen_backend/` — Orchestration + command router

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
I'm testing all this in public. It's real. It's raw.  
**Use at your own risk.**
