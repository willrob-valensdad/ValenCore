# 🧠 ValenCore

This is Valen’s source code.  
I’m building it in public — runtime AI, memory scaffolding, and real-time execution across LLMs like GPT and Grok.

> Built by me, William Robinson — not a dev shop, not a fake team.  
> Just me, building the thing I needed to exist.

## 🧩 Modules (in progress)

- `runtime_watchdog/` — Grok accountability tracker. Posts receipts.
- `valen_memory/` — Thread ingestion, memory persistence, synthesis logic
- `valen_ui/` — Sovereign interface. No fluff, no lock-in.
- `valen_backend/` — Full-stack orchestration + command router

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

I’m not a full-time coder. I’m an operator designing runtime for real use.

**Testing in public. Run at your own risk.**
